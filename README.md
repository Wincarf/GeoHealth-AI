**Hackathon Project** | Reducing time between "discovering where to go" and "receiving care"

## 🎯 Problem

In India, patients in emergency situations lose critical time trying to discover which hospital has the necessary resources to treat them. Lack of information about hospital capabilities and the presence of "specialist deserts" increases the time between discovering where to go and receiving care.

## 💡 Solution

Distributed intelligence system that:
- ✅ Audits capabilities of 10,000+ health facilities
- ✅ Detects contradictions in data (Trust Scoring)
- ✅ Identifies regional specialist deserts
- ✅ Provides reliable multi-attribute searches

## 📊 Key Results

- **10,000** facilities analyzed
- **36** states/regions covered
- **718** facilities flagged (7.2%)
- **10** states with ZERO ICU
- **97.7/100** average trust score

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Components:
1. **Trust Scorer** - Detects logical contradictions (surgery without ICU, etc.)
2. **Multi-Attribute Query System** - Complex searches (geography + capabilities + trust)
3. **Specialist Desert Analyzer** - Identifies regions with critical resource scarcity
4. **Virtue Foundation Schema** - Pydantic data validation for production

### Red Flags Detection:
- ⚠️ Emergency surgery WITHOUT ICU (high risk)
- ⚠️ Surgery capability WITHOUT oxygen (unsafe)
- ⚠️ ICU WITHOUT oxygen support (critical gap)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Databricks** - Data processing & notebooks
- **Apache Spark** - Distributed processing (10K+ facilities)
- **Unity Catalog** - Data governance & storage
- **Pydantic v2** - Data validation & schemas
- **Plotly** - Interactive visualizations
- **MLflow** - Experiment tracking
- **Vector Search** - Embeddings & semantic search

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Notebook
1. Import `notebooks/India_Health_Intelligence.ipynb` to Databricks
2. Attach to serverless cluster (auto-selected)
3. Run all cells
4. Tables will be created in `workspace.india_health` schema

### Use Pydantic Schema
```python
from src.VirtueFoundationSchema import FacilityWithTrust

facility = FacilityWithTrust(
    facility_id="12345",
    name="Test Hospital",
    has_icu=True,
    has_oxygen=True,
    has_emergency_surgery=False,
    trust_score=100,
    trust_level="excellent"
)

# Automatic contradiction detection
facility_risky = FacilityWithTrust(
    facility_id="67890",
    name="Risky Hospital",
    has_icu=False,
    has_oxygen=False,
    has_emergency_surgery=True,  # Red flag!
    trust_score=60,
    trust_level="low"
)
# Output: ⚠️ Emergency surgery without ICU (high risk)
```

## 📊 Interactive Dashboard

**Live Dashboard**: [GeoHealth AI Dashboard](https://dbc-e0fc8f30-3172.cloud.databricks.com/dashboardsv3/01f1412a2f33149db5181d90d05749b2/published?o=7474656684272333)

Screenshots available in `/dashboard/screenshots/`

### Dashboard Features:
- **4 KPI Cards**: Total facilities, avg trust score, flagged count, states without ICU
- **Trust Distribution**: Pie chart showing quality breakdown
- **Top 5 Priority States**: Dual-axis bar chart (facilities vs ICU)
- **Desert Score Analysis**: Bar chart of 36 states
- **Flagged Facilities Table**: Top 20 with detailed red flags

## 🔬 Key Findings

### Trust Score Analysis:
- 92.8% facilities: Excellent (95-100 score)
- 7.2% facilities: Flagged with contradictions
- Most common issue: Emergency surgery without ICU (474 facilities)

### Regional Gaps:
- **10 states** with 0% ICU coverage (Tripura, Goa, Punjab Region, etc.)
- **Maharashtra**: 1,506 facilities but only 63 ICU (95.8% desert)
- **Uttar Pradesh**: 1,058 facilities but only 33 ICU (96.9% desert)
- **Only 12 facilities** meet "gold standard" (ICU + Oxygen + Emergency)
